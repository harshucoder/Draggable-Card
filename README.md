This project demonstrates how to create draggable cards with constraints using React and Framer Motion. The cards are limited to stay within a defined area and cannot be dragged outside of their container.

## Features

- **Draggable Cards**: Users can drag the cards around within the container.
- **Constraints**: Cards are constrained to stay within the boundaries of the container.
- **Dynamic Styles**: Card colors and other styles are dynamically set based on the data passed to them.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: Library for animations and gesture handling in React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
